## Properties: 
    1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
    2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
    3. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees
    4. No two nodes data is same.
    5. Inorder traversal of BST is give output in assending order
